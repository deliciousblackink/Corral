# Corral

A dead-simple, fast, very opinionated, pure Ruby ACL module for Rails applications.

This project is mostly the Sinatra to  Rails's [CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan).

This gem was written with speed and very specific requirements in mind. You probably want CanCanCan, so please check that out first!
